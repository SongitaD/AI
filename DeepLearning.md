# Deep Learning
Deep learning is a way to teach computers to learn and make decisions on their own by using models that are inspired by how our brains work. 
These models, called neural networks, have many layers that process data step by step.

## Example:
Imagine you want a computer to tell whether a photo is of a cat or a dog. 
Instead of telling it exactly what to look for, you feed it thousands of pictures of cats and dogs. 
The deep learning model starts by recognizing simple things like edges or colors in the first layer, and as the information moves through more layers, 
it learns more complex features like shapes, textures, or specific patterns unique to cats or dogs. 
Eventually, it becomes good at deciding if a new photo shows a cat or a dogâ€”all by learning from examples.

# Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning

**Machine Learning** is a broad field where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions. It includes a variety of techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, often relying on manually selected features.

**Deep Learning** is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers. These networks automatically learn the features from raw data, which is especially useful for complex tasks like image or speech recognition.


| **Aspect**              | **Machine Learning**                                          | **Deep Learning**                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Uses statistical methods and algorithms to learn from data.   | Uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically learn features.  |
| **Feature Engineering** | Often requires manual selection and engineering of features.  | Automatically extracts features from raw data.                       |
| **Data Requirements**   | Works well with smaller datasets.                             | Generally needs large amounts of data for optimal performance.         |
| **Computational Power** | Typically less computationally intensive; works on CPUs.       | More computationally demanding; often requires GPUs/TPUs.              |
| **Interpretability**    | Models like decision trees or linear regression are more interpretable. | Neural networks can be more of a "black box."                          |
| **Complexity of Tasks** | Suitable for simpler to moderately complex tasks.             | Excels at handling highly complex tasks like image and speech recognition. |
| **Examples**            | Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.                  | CNNs, RNNs, etc.                                                       |


Deep Learning completely automates the step of feature engineering and this is a major advantage.
