This project(PredictStock) takes stock ticker as an input and gets stock data using Yahoo Finance API for last 5 years. Then it uses LSTM from Tensorflow/Keras to use a prediction model using the data (80% training/20%testing).
We then use Python Matplotlib to plot and predict the movement of the stock in next 90 days.


I am also including some basic alogorithm implementations for Machine Learning.

There are many types of machine learning models, each suited for different kinds of tasks. Here's a simple breakdown:

# Machine Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning Models
These models learn from data that includes the “right answers” (labels).

### a. Regression Models:
Example: Linear Regression predicts continuous outcomes (like predicting house prices) by finding a straight-line relationship in the data.

### b. Classification Models:
Example: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees classify data into categories (like deciding if an email is spam or not).

### c. Other Examples:
Support Vector Machines (SVM): They find a boundary that best separates different classes.

### Neural Networks: 
Inspired by the human brain, these models can learn complex patterns and are used for tasks like image and speech recognition.


Ensemble Methods:
Example: Random Forests combine many decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.



## 2. Unsupervised Learning Models
These models work with data that doesn’t have labels, and they try to find patterns or groupings on their own.

### Clustering Models:
Example: K-Means groups similar data points together, which can help in segmenting customers or organizing information.
Dimensionality Reduction Models:
Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the number of features while keeping the most important information, making data easier to visualize and work with.



## 3. Reinforcement Learning Models
These models learn by interacting with an environment. An agent takes actions and learns what to do by receiving rewards or penalties.

Example: In a video game, the model (or agent) learns strategies by trying different moves, receiving points for good moves, and avoiding mistakes to improve its score over time.
Each type of model has its strengths and is chosen based on the specific problem you’re trying to solve. Machine learning is all about finding the right tool for the job, whether it’s predicting numbers, classifying items, grouping similar things together, or learning from interactions.
