This project(PredictStock) takes stock ticker as an input and gets stock data using Yahoo Finance API for last 5 years. Then it uses LSTM from Tensorflow/Keras to use a prediction model using the data (80% training/20%testing).
We then use Python Matplotlib to plot and predict the movement of the stock in next 90 days.
